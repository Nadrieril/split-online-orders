# Grocery order splitting scripts

When we order groceries for our house, we need to split the expense among ourselves.
I have a Google Sheet spreadsheet with boxes to split the expense,
but the hard bit is extracting the list of items and prices from whatever format
the shop uses.

This repo contains scripts for that.
